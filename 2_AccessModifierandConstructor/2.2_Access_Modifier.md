## Access modifier
> An access modifier defines the accessibility of a class, attribute, method or constructor. There are
four types of access modifiers in Java: public, protected, default (no modifier), and private.

There are four types of access modifiers in Java:
- **public :** The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the
class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package
- **protected :**  The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package
through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the
package.
- **private :**  The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from
outside the class.
- **default :**  The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed
from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.
