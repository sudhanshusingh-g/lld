### Interfaces
An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to a class, but it cannot be instantiated. It can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.

It can be thought of as a blueprint of behavior. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

### Why use an interface?
- It is used to achieve abstraction.
- Due to multiple inheritance, it can achieve loose coupling.
- Define a common behavior for unrelated classes.

### How to create an interface?
Let us create an interface for a Person
```java
public interface Person {
    String getName();
    String getEmail();
}
```
Now let's create a class that implements the Person interface:
```java
public class User implements Person {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    @Override
    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
}
```

## If there is common behaviour
## - No common state -> Interface
## - If duplicate -> default keyword in interface.
