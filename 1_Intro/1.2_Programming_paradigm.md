Two types of programming paradigm we use to write a code
- Imperative
- Declarative

# Imperative programming
> Imperative programming focuses on describing a sequence of steps to achieve the desired result. It emphasizes how a program should perform a task.
> In imperative programming, developers explicitly specify the steps that the computer must take to execute a task. The code consists of statements that change a program's state.
> Variables are often mutable, meaning their values can be changed during the execution of the program.
> Procedural programming languages like C, Pascal, and traditional object-oriented languages like Java and C++ follow imperative programming paradigms.
```
// Function to calculate the sum of elements in an array
function calculateSum(array) {
    // Initialize a variable to store the sum
    sum = 0
    
    // Iterate through each element in the array
    for i from 0 to length of array - 1 {
        // Add the current element to the sum
        sum = sum + array[i]
    }
    
    // Return the final sum
    return sum
}

// Example usage
// Define an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Call the calculateSum function with the array
result = calculateSum(numbers)

// Print the result
print("The sum of the elements is: " + result)

```
# Declarative programming
> Declarative programming focuses on describing what a program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve it. It emphasizes expressing the logic rather than the control flow.
> Programs are written as a set of expressions or declarations that describe the relationships between input and output.
> Variables are often treated as immutable, and the emphasis is on defining the relationships between different parts of the program.
> Functional programming languages like Haskell, Lisp, and modern JavaScript (when using functional constructs) follow declarative programming paradigms.

We will be focusing on the imperative paradigm which has the two following subtypes.

## Procedural Programming
It is based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures (a type of routine or subroutine) simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.

**Think of all programming as managing the relationship between two fundamental concepts: state and behavior. State is the data of your program. Behavior is the logic.**

Procedural codes **PROS**:
- Easy to write
- Modular
- State + Behaviour are loosely coupled

Procedural codes **CONS**:
- Shared state everywhere.
- Codes are not very extensible.
- Security vulnerable as states are shared everywhere.

## Object Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming is based on implementing the state and behaviour concepts together. State and behaviour are combined into one new concept: an Object. An OO application can therefore produce some output by calling an Object, without needing to pass data structures.
OOP codes **PROS**:
- Modularity and Reusability.
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

OOP codes **CONS**:
- Verbosity.
- Banana Gorilla Problem.
