### Static keyword
>The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with
variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the
class.Static methods are methods that can be called without creating an instance of the class. They are declared
using the static keyword.

Static can be :
- Variable
- Method
- Block
- Class

**Static variable**
```
public class Example {
    static int staticVariable = 5;
}

public static void main(){
    Example ex=new Example();
    System.out.println(Example.staticVariable);//5
}

```
**Static method**
```
public class Example {
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}
public static void main(){
    Example ex=new Example();
    System.out.println(Example.staticMethod());//This is a static method.
}

```

Static methods can only access static variables and other static methods. They can not access non-static
variables and methods by default. If you try to access a non-static variable or method from a static method,
the compiler will throw an error.
