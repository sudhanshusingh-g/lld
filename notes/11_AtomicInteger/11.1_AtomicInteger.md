`AtomicInteger` is a class in Java that belongs to the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package. It provides an atomic, thread-safe way of updating and manipulating integer variables without the need for explicit synchronization using locks.
Some of the key methods provided by AtomicInteger include:

- `get()`: Returns the current value of the AtomicInteger.

- `set(int newValue)`: Sets the value of the AtomicInteger to the specified new value.

- `getAndIncrement()`: Atomically increments the current value by 1 and returns the previous value.

- `getAndDecrement()`: Atomically decrements the current value by 1 and returns the previous value.

- `incrementAndGet()`: Atomically increments the current value by 1 and returns the updated value.

- `decrementAndGet()`: Atomically decrements the current value by 1 and returns the updated value.

- `addAndGet(int delta)`: Atomically adds the specified value to the current value and returns the updated value.

- `getAndAdd(int delta)`: Atomically adds the specified value to the current value and returns the previous value.

The use of AtomicInteger is particularly beneficial in scenarios where multiple threads might concurrently access and modify the same integer variable. Traditional approaches involving locks can be more complex and may introduce the risk of deadlocks or performance issues. AtomicInteger simplifies such scenarios by providing atomic operations, ensuring that updates are performed in a thread-safe manner without the need for explicit locks.

Using Atomic Integer will:
- Reduce performance as it uses lock implicit locks.
- Memory footprint will increase.
