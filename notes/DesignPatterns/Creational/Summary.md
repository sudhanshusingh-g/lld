| Pattern                | When to Use It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Key Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Singleton              | When you need to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | - Ensures there's only one instance of the class throughout the application. <br>- Provides a global access point to that instance.<br>- Lazy initialization or eager initialization options.                                                                                                        |
| Factory Method         | When you want to define an interface for creating an object, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.                                                                                                                                                                          | - Decouples object creation from client code by providing a common interface. <br>- Allows subclasses to provide specific implementations of object creation. <br>- Promotes code scalability and maintainability by supporting multiple object creation algorithms or strategies. |
| Abstract Factory       | When you need to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | - Encapsulates the creation of multiple related objects into one interface. <br>- Provides a way to ensure that created objects are compatible with each other or belong to the same family.                                                                                                          |
| Builder                | When you want to construct complex objects step by step, allowing different variations or representations of an object to be created using the same construction process.                                                                                                                                    | - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. <br>- Allows for the creation of different representations of the same object. <br>- Simplifies object construction by providing a clear and consistent construction process.                                              |
| Prototype              | When creating objects is more efficient by copying an existing object rather than creating it from scratch, or when you want to avoid the cost of initializing an object by using a pre-existing instance as a prototype.                                                                                         | - Allows for efficient object creation by copying existing objects. <br>- Facilitates the creation of new objects with minimal overhead. <br>- Can hide the complexities of object creation from clients.                                                                                                   |
