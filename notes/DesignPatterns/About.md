Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide guidelines on
how to structure code to achieve certain objectives efficiently, while also promoting code reuse, maintainability, and
scalability.

The benchmarked book **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.**, published in 1994, was
authored by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, collectively known as the **Gang of Four**.
This book catalog 23 design patterns divided in 3 broad categories.

1. [Creational](/notes/DesignPatterns/Creational)

   Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
2. [Structural](/notes/DesignPatterns/Structural)
   
    Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
3. [Behavioral](/notes/DesignPatterns/Behavioral)
