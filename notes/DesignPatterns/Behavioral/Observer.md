The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject or observable) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is often used to implement distributed event handling systems, where changes in one object trigger actions in other objects without them being tightly coupled.

### Structure
- **Subject (Observable)**: This is the object being observed. It maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and provides methods to register, remove, and notify observers of changes in its state.
- **Observer**: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the contract for all concrete observers. It typically includes a method (such as update()) that is called by the subject to notify observers of changes.
- **Concrete Observer**: These are the concrete implementations of the observer interface. They register themselves with the subject to receive notifications and define the actions to be taken when notified.

### Example
Let's consider an example where a news publisher acts as the subject and various news subscribers act as observers. Whenever a new news article is published, all subscribers are notified and receive the latest news.

### When to Use
- Use the Observer Pattern when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects, and changes to one object require other objects to be notified and updated automatically.
- Use it when you want to decouple the sender and receiver of notifications, allowing for flexible and reusable code.
- Use it in event-driven architectures, GUI frameworks, and systems with distributed components.
