In `Runnable` interface we have seen that we call `run` method and the return type is `void`. If we want to execute a
task that returns a result, we use `Callable` interface.
It has only one method `call`.

```java
public interface Callable<V> {
    /**
     * Computes a result, or throws an exception if unable to do so.
     *
     * @return computed result
     * @throws Exception if unable to compute a result
     */
    V call() throws Exception;
}
```
`call` method returns result of generic type `<V>`. the call method can throw an exception.

The `ExecutorService` is used which accept Callable object parameter. It has a methods like `submit` which returns a
`Future` object.
The `Future` interface has a method called get that returns the result of the task. The `get` method is a blocking method.
It waits until the task is completed and then returns the result of the task.

```
ExecutorService executor= Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<String> returnValue=executor.submit(callObj);
System.out.println(returnValue.get());
```
