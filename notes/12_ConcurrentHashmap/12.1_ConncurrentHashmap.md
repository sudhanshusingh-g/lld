`HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap` are both implementations of the Map interface in Java, but they have different
characteristics, especially regarding thread safety.



### HashMap
- `Thread Safety`: Not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a HashMap concurrently and at least one of the threads
modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally (for example, using
`Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>()))`.
- `Performance`: Generally faster in a single-threaded environment.
- `Use Case`: Suitable for single-threaded or read-only scenarios where there is no concurrent modification.

### ConcurrentHashMap
- `Thread Safety`: Designed to be thread-safe without the need for external synchronization. It allows multiple threads 
to read and write concurrently without blocking.
- `Performance`: Performance is optimized for concurrent access. It uses various techniques like partitioning the map
into segments to allow multiple threads to operate on different segments simultaneously.
- `Use Case`: Suitable for scenarios with high concurrent access and updates, where the performance of concurrent
operations is essential.

### Differences:

- HashMap requires external synchronization for concurrent access, which can lead to contention and reduced performance in
a highly concurrent environment.
- ConcurrentHashMap provides a higher level of concurrency by allowing multiple threads to read and write concurrently
without explicit external synchronization.
- ConcurrentHashMap does not throw ConcurrentModificationException during iteration, even if the map is modified by
another thread. However, it provides weakly consistent iterators.

### When to Choose:

- If you need a map in a single-threaded environment or with external synchronization, HashMap may be sufficient.
- If you have a highly concurrent environment where multiple threads need to read and write to the map concurrently,
and you want to avoid explicit synchronization, ConcurrentHashMap is a better choice.
