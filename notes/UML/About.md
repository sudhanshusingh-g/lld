UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. It is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering. UML provides a set of graphic notations for creating visual models of object-oriented software systems. These visual models can help in understanding, designing, documenting, and communicating about the structure and behavior of software systems.

Some of the key features of UML include:

**Structural Diagrams**: These diagrams represent the static structure of a system, including classes, objects, components, and their relationships. Examples include class diagrams, object diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams.

**Behavioral Diagrams**: These diagrams represent the dynamic behavior of a system, including interactions between objects, states of objects, and the flow of control within the system. Examples include use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, state machine diagrams, and communication diagrams.

**Use Case Modeling**: Use case diagrams are particularly useful for capturing functional requirements from the perspective of end-users. They depict the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and the system itself.

**Modeling Relationships**: UML provides various types of relationships to represent connections between elements in a model, such as association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, dependency, and realization.

**Modeling Tools**: There are many tools available that support UML modeling, allowing users to create, edit, and visualize UML diagrams. These tools often provide features for generating code from UML diagrams and reverse-engineering code into UML diagrams.
