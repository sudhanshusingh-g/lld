### How to use thread
In Java, we can create a thread by extending the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface. The Thread class is a subclass of the Object class. It implements the Runnable interface. The Runnable interface has a single method called run(). This method is called when the thread is started.
```java
class ExampleThread implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
    }
}
```

```java
ExampleThread newThread = new ExampleThread();
Thread thread = new Thread(newThread);
```

``java
thread.start();
``
