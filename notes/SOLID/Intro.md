What is a good design of code?

Good designed codes are:
- **Maintainable**:Code is easy to read, understand, modify, and reuse by yourself and others.
- **Extensible**:Code should not be fixed/static.Someone can add a new feature without editing any existing code other
than configuration. 
- **Scalable**: Code that can handle increasing amounts of data, traffic, or complexity without compromising performance
, reliability, or maintainability.

### Design principles
1. SOLID
2. GRASP
3. CUPID

> SOLID principles are most widely used.
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
