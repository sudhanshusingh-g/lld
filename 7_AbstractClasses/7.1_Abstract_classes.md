### Abstract Classes
An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract. It may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.

### Why use an abstract class?
- It is used to achieve abstraction.
- It can have abstract methods and non-abstract methods.
- When you don't want to provide the implementation of a method, you can make it abstract.
- When you don't want to allow the instantiation of a class, you can make it abstract.

### How to create an abstract class?
Let us create an abstract class for a Person You can create an abstract class by using the abstract keyword. Similarly, you can create an abstract method by using the **abstract** keyword.
```java
public abstract Person {

    public abstract String getName();
    public abstract String getEmail();
}
```
Now let's create a class that extends the Person abstract class:
```java
public class User extends Person {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    @Override
    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
}
```
